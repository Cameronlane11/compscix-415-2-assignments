## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
?mpg
```
3.2.4 Question 1: without GEOM, nothing appears
3.2.4 Question 2:  mpg contains 234 rows and 11 columns
3.2.4 Question 3: drv means f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
3.2.4 Question 4
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```

3.2.4 Question 5:
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = cyl))
```
not useful because theyre is no 1:1 correlation between type of car and cylendars (class may have multiple cylendars. They are not dependent on eachother)
3.3.1 Question 1: instead of color = blue, you want the color = variable
3.3.1 Question 2: categorical variables are: all except disp
Question 3
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = year))
```

Question 4
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = year, size = year))
```
answer: you get multiple aestetics to the same variable
Question5 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy,stroke = hwy))
```
makes huge bubbles!

Question 6: 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy,color = hwy < 20
                      ))
```
shows a true false for when values do and don't meet the criteria


 3.5.1 Question 4
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```
 it adds multi dementions to review, it's nice ot have the information grouped and plotted by selected facet
 
 Question 5
```{r}
?facet_wrap
```
 Nrow is the number of rows,ncolis the number of columsn. you can control them with this code p + facet_wrap(vars(class), nrow
 
 3.6.1
 Question 1 What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A: geom_abline()
 A boxplot?geom_boxplot()
 A histogram? geom_histogram()
 An area chart?geom_area() 
 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
question 3. show legend false will not show legend, true will, makes sense to show it
Question 4: SE is the Display confidence interval around smooth (true is default)
Question 5: they will look the same because they have the same x and y and geoms
Question 6
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
geom_smooth()
```

3.7.1 Question 2
geom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each selection. geom_col() represents the values in the dataset
